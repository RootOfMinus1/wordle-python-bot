# wordle-python-bot
A discord bot written in discord.py that allows you to play wordle, currently WIP.

This is my 1st time making a game command more advanced than number guessing, so I don't know if what I have is good or bad practice. 

That's why I'm asking you, dear viewer, for feedback. Tell me what you think about the code, tell me where and how I could improve it. What should I change and how? Be as nitpicky as you wish.

I could use suggestions ranging my data structure and management, through the algorithms that I'm using, to readability and paradigms that I should be using for these kinds of "simple but still complicated to code" games.



Oh and yeah the commands have a 2 in them, because this is the 2nd version. The 1st version was even messier and didn't have proper letter color highlighting.
