# wordle-python-bot
A discord bot written in discord.py that allows you to play wordle, currently WIP.

This is my 1st time making a game command more advanced than number guessing, so I don't know if what I have is good or bad practice. 

That's why I'm asking you, dear viewer, for feedback. Tell me what you think about the code, tell me where and how I could improve it. What should I change and how? Be as nitpicky as you wish.
